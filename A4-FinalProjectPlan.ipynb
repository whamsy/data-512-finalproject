    "# DATA 512 - Final Project Plan \n",
    "\n",
    "## Submitted by: Vamsy Atluri \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Statement - Gender Diversity in Movies\n",
    "\n",
    "I have often found that movies are sometimes the most powerful medium of expression, with their widespread reach to a huge section of  population. It is an industry which often brings topics into social discussion by portraying them on a screen. I come from India where gender stereotypes are more strictly enforced and with a few exceptions, women in movies are more often that not arm candy. At the time, american movies which potrayed strong women characters was a widely different and refreshing experience. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nowadays, the industry and media claim that gender diversity is improving and more and more women are playing major roles than ever. I wish to use the data science skills I have learnt over the past year and analyze this claim in more detail. How gender diverse are movies really in terms of actors on the screen? I will be comparing the total number of actresses to the total number of actors over a time period of the last few decades.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is this important?\n",
    "\n",
    "Movies like any other industry are aimed at making money. Companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon etc have started to enforce gender equality requirements trying to make the workplace more diverse than becoming stereotypical male dominated companies. The aim of this project is to see where the movie industry falls when looking at the people acting in them. We obviously know for sure that it was a male dominated industry for several decades and might still be. But has there been a change in this percentage over the years?\n",
    "\n",
    "My hope is that movie makers, historians, film studies majors, cultural scientists and people who study about society at large will be able to derive a variety of answers from this analytic directly or by building on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are the human-centered aspects of this project?\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis of data which is aimed at seeing how diversity in the movie industry has changed over time and the visualization of the results which shows the trends. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary sources of data used in this project are from IMDB, which are hosted [here](https://datasets.imdbws.com/). A desciption of the datasets and the various fields are given [here](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/). \n",
    "\n",
    "Three of the available data sources (title.basics.tsv.gz, name.basic.tsv.gz, title.principals.tsv.gz ) are in my opinion at the moment, sufficent for the purposes of this project and which I plan to work on. If they prove inadequate, I will augment them with the other data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Handling Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the data is made available as .tsv (tab separated value) files, pythons [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library will be useful and adequate to create subset dataframes and perform my analysis. Also the size of these datasets range in a few hundred MBs which makes it convenient to stick to pandas rather than having to use Big Data tools like Hadoop, Pig etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Each dataset is contained in a gzipped, tab-separated-values (TSV) formatted file in the UTF-8 character set. The first line in each file contains headers that describe what is in each column. A ‘\\N’ is used to denote that a particular field is missing for that title/name --- ([reference](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "I will be showing the structure of all the relevant sources below."

Regular companies often claim to have a [diverse workforce](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/diversity-in-tech/) in terms of gender even if this diversity is restricted to lower rungs of the organization and does not extend to the upper tiers which have the major decision makers.\n",
